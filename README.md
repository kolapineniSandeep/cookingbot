# cookingbot

CookingBot is a chatbot trained using a Bidirectional LSTM neural network to assist users with their cooking-related questions and needs. It was developed to provide quick and easy recipe ideas, cooking techniques, and ingredient substitutions.

The neural network was trained on a large corpus of cooking-related text data, including recipes, cooking instructions, and food blogs. This allowed the model to learn the nuances of cooking terminology and techniques, as well as understand the intent behind user queries.

The model architecture used for CookingBot is a Bidirectional LSTM, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). The bidirectional aspect allows the model to take into account both past and future inputs when making predictions, improving the accuracy of the model.
